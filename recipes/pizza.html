        (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.)br
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. </p>

    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (105-115 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing the bowl</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the work surface</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>how to make</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let stand for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy. </li>
        <li>Stir in the olive oil, flour, and salt. Stir until the dough comes together. </li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. </li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl with olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to a 12-inch circle. </li>
        <li> Spread the pizza sauce over the dough. Top with your favorite toppings. </li>
        <li> Bake the pizza for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. </li>
    </ol>
